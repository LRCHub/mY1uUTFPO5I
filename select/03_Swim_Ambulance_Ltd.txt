Drive you in, drive you in
I swim
Down the coast on a...
To the sand

Raise the sand to the wind
I'll leave
See the hills on the land

I won't come home till after
I've shaken hands with native lands
And kiss the old friends back there
Cause I wanted water

Drive you in, drive you in
I swim
Reach the edge of the shore
Dive in

I won't come home till after
I've shaken hands with native lands
And kiss the old friends back there
Cause I wanted water
