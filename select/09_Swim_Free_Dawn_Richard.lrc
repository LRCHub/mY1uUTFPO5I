[00:26.22] I left you at sea
[00:31.46] Hoping you'd forgive me
[00:38.20] I left you at sea, at sea
[00:53.97] My feet needed to touch land
[00:57.13] But you were made to swim free
[01:12.13] 
[01:07.16] Swim free
[01:11.66] 
[01:16.36] I left you at sea
[01:20.21] Farewell my lovely
[01:31.39] I left you at sea
[01:36.13] Farewell my lovely
[01:45.13] 
[02:12.82] I left you at sea
[02:13.57] Hoping you'd forgive me
[02:15.72] One day I hope I'll see you again
