You fill my heart with peace
Your presence consumes me
With joy I sing to you
Your spirit now moves me

The cross You carried to Calvary
Walked, knelt, bled and died for me
With your mercy I am saved
My life is in your hand

I am blessed by Your love
And I'll never be the same
Blessed by Your love oh Lord

I am blessed by Your love
And forever I'll be Yours
Blessed by Your love oh Lord
